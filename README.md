# AppleHealthXMLJavascriptParser
A very simple javascript XML parser for Apple Health files

I don't know how universally it will work, but it itterates through the XML object. Currently I don't bother extracting any of the data that isn't a 'record'. The program produces HTML tables with a nagivation structure and links to copy tables for pasting into Excel. Cheap and cheerful.
